<p>Garage Door Repair Won T Stay Closed Or Go Down Youtube The solution is usually one or more of the following. Videos you watch may be added to the TVs watch. Ive had this before. Can happen either from the wired connector in the garage or one of the remotes from the outside. If it closes before that distance has been traveled it thinks something is wrong and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. If your garage door opens and immediately closes it could be due to the limit settings on the opener.</p>

<p>Why Does My Garage Door Open Again After Closing Clopay But changes in weather conditions can causes your. Im sure there is more than one cause of this problem but for me the issue was that the door was getting snagged slightly and once the chain pulls with too much tension it has an automatic failsafe and it stops pulling and lets the door down. But changes in weather conditions can causes your. If you release the door from the opener using the release cord see image below you should be able to lift the door to half open by hand and the door should stay at that point if you release it. Typically when the door is in the up position the bottom of it should be even with or slightly lower than the upper frame of the garage door. Garage Door sometimes opens a few inches and stops then closes and opens all the way.</p>
