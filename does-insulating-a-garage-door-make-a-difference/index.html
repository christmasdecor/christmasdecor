<p>Is It Better To Have A Steel Back Garage Door Or Insulated One The insulation does more than just provide a buffer between the cold and your garage space it also absorbs many of the rattling sounds a door will naturally make when its in motion and on top of that it absorbs far more noise coming from the street. Yes if you first seal gaps and do a cost-benefit analysis. Garage door insulation can make your life warmer cooler and quieter. And thats the point.
