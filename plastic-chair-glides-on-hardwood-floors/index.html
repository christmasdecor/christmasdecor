Perfect protection under chairs other furniture for hardwood ceramic or linoleum flooring. The one and only chair glides that I personally recommend are the Alimitopia Thickened Furniture Glides simple because they are 100 times better than all the chair glides Ive tried. The styles vary to give you flexibility to suit the furniture with plastic inserts that slot over or glides that can be nailed-in for a more permanent fix we are sure you will find what you need.
