The photo eye will be about 46 inches off the ground for most doors with an eye about the size of a pea. Here are the eight most common problems along with the most likely repairs for each. This board electrically controls your garage door and will fail if it shorts out. Test your doors balance by disconnecting it from the automatic opener.</p>

<p>Garage Doors That Won T Open 15 Reasons You Can T Get It Up If you notice that your garage door opens slowly or if there are any grinding noises you should get your alignment fixed immediately. In an opposite situation you may find that your garage door isnt opening all the way when you push the button on the opener so that you can drive in. The slightest detection such as accumulated leaves snow or ice around the garage door can cause the door to. This button could be the cause of your ghostly garage issue especially if its old dirty or just plain stuck. We recommend taking either the battery or the remote to the store to ensure you get the right size. The photo-eye components consist of two pieces that align face-to-face across each side of the garage door roughly four feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Why Your Garage Door Won T Fully Open Banko Overhead Doors Lubricating the springs hinges and other metal parts can help your door to move easily. This brain can wear out in time so you could need a replacement. A faulty logic board could also be a reason your garage door opens then stops. In cold temperature the space between molecules reduces making the metal shrinks. On the other hand if your opener is fairly new you may want to call a professional. If the garage door opens and closes okay when you use the wall station but not your remote the most likely issue is a dead battery.</p>

<p>Garage Doors Door Off Its Tracks Garaga There could be a bind or drag in the door mechanism or the springs may be damaged or need adjusting. Just like the torsion springs they make it easier to lift a large heavy garage door. One or more of these reasons is likely responsible for your garage door closing partially but not all the way. Pull your garage door so its about halfway open. Opener manually lift the garage door. This button could be the cause of your ghostly garage issue especially if its old dirty or just plain stuck.</p>
