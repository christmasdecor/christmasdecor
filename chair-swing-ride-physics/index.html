<p>Solved Problem 2 3 Points A Swing Ride At A Carnival Chegg Com Developed in the early 1800s by Franz Schwarzkopf the fairground ride is a variation of the carousel in which chairs are suspended by chains from the rotating top of a carousel. The swing ride is a perfect family ride and families will certainly love hanging out on this ride mainly because it isnt too scary but it is still thrilling. On some versions particularly on the Wave Swingers the rotating top of the carousel also tilts for additional variations of motion. θ 555 Suppose the total mass of a chair and its occupant is 192 kg. Swing carousel ride forces. When the chair swing ride starts the metal top begins to rotate slowly and accordingly the chairs hanged by chains begin to move in circle.</p>
