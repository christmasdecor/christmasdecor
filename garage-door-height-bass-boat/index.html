I store mine in a 12 x 30 garage with a 10 foot high door might be 11. If I had it to do over again 8 tall garage door for 8 power pole. You can either purchase a. The bow of the boat clears the door about 18. Lets get a little more detailed with this answer.</p>

<p>Xt 22 Height On A Trailer Teamtalk Height is not an issue as I am going 12 high so I dont have to lower the tower each time for my 05 VLX. The garage I had intended to store it in is 81 from the ground to the lip of the garage door when it is all the way up. If I had it to do over again 8 tall garage door for 8 power pole. I think that a 24 deep garage would hold an 18 ft boat with standard trailer. I am able to back my boat in with out lowering the power pole. How do you park your boat in the garage with Power-Poles attached.</p>
